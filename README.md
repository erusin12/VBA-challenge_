# VBA-challenge
 This Challenge is to show our knowledge of VBA.  The workbook has 3 years, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and various information about stocks from the years.  We were supposed to find the annual change, percent change, and aggregate stock volume for each ticker.  We then had to provide the stock with the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease and greatest total volume.

 Because our classwork had not covered many of these elements, we were provided a skeleton code.  Based on prior examples and with the help of study groups, a starter code was developed, however there were errors when I ran the code.  I used internet resources recommended by my tutor to then work through the errors and help to debug the code to get it to run.

 Screenshots were submitted to show the three years as well as the macro enabled workbook and the exported macro.
